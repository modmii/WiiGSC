# FE100

**FE100 is the port of segher's tachtig & twintig Nintendo wii savegame command line utilities for Windows.**

There is an additional utility provided in this port

**FE100 Keygrabber**
- pulls some wii public encryption keys&constants of the web (Weird idea actually)
- pulls keys spesific to your wii from a savefile (from your Wii)
- pulls private keys from either a full nand dump provided you give your nand's private key or from a xyzzy tool's output
- you can get the private stuff directly from your Wii if you have your Wii connected to local network and your Homebrew Channel open. You simply provide your Wii's ip address and KeyGrabber tools uses Homebrew Channel's wiiload server to send a keygrabbing application and gets the keys from that application.
