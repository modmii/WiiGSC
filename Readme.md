# Software related to the Wii


I'll be sharing the source code of Wii tools developed by me here...

You can find the binary releases for this programs on my homepage here : http://www.tepetaklak.com/wii/

Beware that None of them is actively developed so I can't guarantee that you can even compile them, I'm just pushing them here from a non development environment.

- SaveTemper is the code name for the FE100 tool. I guess (it's 14 years old) FE is iron's (which is my nick) chemical element symbol and 100 is the sum of 80+20 which are referring to original programs created by Segher. This software is a simplification effort for the end user for those programs, namely tachtig (eighty) and twintig (twenty).
