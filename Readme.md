# Software related to the Wii


I'll be sharing the source code of Wii tools developed by me here...

- SaveTemper is the code name for the FE100 tool. I guess (it's 14 years old) FE is iron's (which is my nick) chemical element symbol and 100 is the sum of 80+20 which are referring to original programs created by Segher. This software is a simplification effort for the end user for those programs, namely tachtig (eighty) and twintig (twenty).
